# Description
This software implements a PID controller in C++ to maneuver the vehicle around the track in a simulator. The simulator will provide the cross track error (CTE) and the velocity (mph) in order to compute the appropriate steering angle.
Two PID controllers are implemented, one for steering control and another for throttle control.

These three controllers are combined in such a way that it produces a control signal. This is how the vehicle uses steering, throttle, and brake to move through the world, executing a trajectory created by the path planning block.

# Fundamentals
PID stands for Proportional-Integral-Differential. The PID Controller is a controller with three coefficients.

 ### Cross Track Error (CTE)
 * It is a distance between the vehicleÂ´s actual trajectory and the groundtruth trajectory. It is best suited to control the vehicle by steering in proportion to CTE.
 
 ### Systematic Bias
* Systematic bias is a problem that often occurs in robotics. The problem is due to mechanics. Buying for example a vehicle, we think the steerable front wheels are 100% aligned. But in reality the wheels can be aligned a little bit at an angle. The systematic bias manifests itself in a steering drift. For humans this is not a big deal because we just countersteer intuitionally but in robotics this is a fact to be considered. 
 
### P-Controller 
* sets the steering angle in proportion to CTE (the coefficient tau_p is called "response strength"):

`steering angle = -tau_p * cte`

* steers the vehicle towards the trajectory but when it reaches the trajectory it overshoots.
* using only P-Controller leads to overshooting and oscillating which is demonstrated in the following graph:

### PD- Controller 
* steering angle is not just proportional to CTE but also to the time derivative of CTE:

`steering angle = -tau_p * cte - tau_d * diff_cte`

* the derivative component countersteers the vehicle and helps not to overshoot the trajectoy and oscillate
* The following graph demonstrates the behaviour of P- and PD-controller.

### PID-Controller
* this controller finally solves the problem of overshooting and systematic bias by adding one more term. In addition to the PD-Controller the steering angle is prportional to the integral of CTE. It sums up the systematic error and compensates it.

`steering angle = -tau_p * cte - tau_d * diff_cte - tau_i * int_cte`

Now it seems like PID is doing worse than PD but this is only because the graphs above assumed an ideal robot with no bias. 

### Twiddle PID-Controller
Below you can see the corresponding P-, PD-  and PID-graphs using a robot with systematic bias. Now you can see that with a real robot with bias the PD-controller is actually not doing better than the PID-Controller.

The dashed line is the goal PID-Controller. We achieve this with a so-called twiddle PID controller (green line) with tuned parameters.
Now the PID controller outshines the PD controller. Also, with twiddle the PID controller converges faster but we overshoot drastically at first. This overshoot can be reduced by tuning the twiddle parameters.

# Implementation and Tuning
Manual tuning of PID coefficients for steering and throttle values.

#### P-Controller
The vehicle drives along the trajectory with oscillations.

#### PD-Controller
The vehicle follows the trajectory with relatively low oscillations.

#### PID-Controller 
The vehicle follows the trajectory but due to overspeeding it shakes while taking turns.

#### PID-Controller for throttle value
The braking while taking turns allows the vehicle to take the turns smoothly.
